# Visualizing-Product-Revenue-with-Python
This project connects to a small SQLite database (sales_data.db) containing a sales table with products, quantities, and prices. It calculates total quantity sold and total revenue per product using a SQL query inside Python, displays the results in a table, and visualizes revenue per product with a simple bar chart (sales_chart.png).
